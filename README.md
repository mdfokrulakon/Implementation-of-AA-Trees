This project implements an AA Tree in C, a form of balanced binary search tree. The AA Tree maintains balance using `skew` and `split` operations, offering efficient insertion, deletion, and search. It includes in-order, 
pre-order, and post-order traversals, and functions to calculate height, count nodes, and find minimum/maximum values. A simple menu-driven CLI allows users to interactively manage the tree. Memory is managed efficiently with proper cleanup.
This project is ideal for learning balanced trees and practicing data structures in C. Compile with `gcc` and run the executable to get started. Licensed under the MIT License.
